This one was very easy for her to use and didn't leak when we used it (and she threw it from the) dinner table. It's a very unique design, but has 3 simple pieces. They were easy to clean and I have put it through the dishwasher several time and none of the plastic has distorted. My daughter does get water all over the place, but that's because she gets it into her mouth then likes to let it dribble it out. Our 3 yo has been fighting to use these cups because he loves both of the designs and how it works. The plastic doesn't smell weird and is sturdy.", "title": "Unique design, kids love them"}
